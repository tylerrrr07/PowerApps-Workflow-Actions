# PowerApps Workflow Actions
This will be a growing set of common workflow (process) actions that will be maintained as long as real time processes and actions are supported in Dynamics 365 and model driven PowerApps.

*Note that these actions do not apply to Flow and are only for Processes*

The support for these plugins will be targeting Dynamics 365 environments 9.x and above but should generally work for older and on premise versions as well.

Current Workflow Actions Include:
* Date String Format 
* Send Email
* Set Active Stage (Business Process Flows)
* Close Quote As Won
